; DATA SEGMENT DEFINITION
DATOS SEGMENT
COUNTERup DW 0 ; Reserve memory for the counter, one word (two bytes), set to 0
ASCIINUM DB 6 DUP (?) ; Reserve memory for the result of the conversion to ASCII, 6 bytes (one for each hexa digit plus one for the '$' plus one for better performance)
DATOS ENDS			  ; One for each hexa digit because to convert one hexadecimal digit, we need to add 30h, so the result will be of 1 byte
					  ; The byte of performance is because we need to reserve an even number of bytes due to internal reasons
