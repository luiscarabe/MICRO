##### Fourth deliverable
Luis CÃ¡rabe and Juan Riera
To generate all the executables type make.
Type make clean to clean the directory (delete the .map, .obj, .com and .exe files)

Important: when executing  p3c.exe the driver p4a2.com must have been the last one to
be installed, if not the encrypted/decrypted strings will be printed twice.

We only encrypt and decrypt lowecase letters, other chars will remain unmodifiable.

It is also important not to type any '$' into the decryption because it will cause malfunction.
